## ðŸš€ Manual Deployment

[Deploy to GitHub Pages from `dist` directory](https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490).
1. Remove `dist`directory from `.gitignore`.

2. Create production bundle:

```sh
npm run build

```
3. Make sure git knows about your subtree (the subfolder with your site).

```sh
git add dist && git commit -m "Initial dist subtree commit"
```

4. Use subtree push to send it to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub.

```sh
git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages
```
